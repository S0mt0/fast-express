      a: "The Fastexpress-courier Express Waybill for Time Definite shipments is a 10 digit numeric number (e.g. 1234567890, 2345678901), so please recheck the number and try again. If your tracking number does not fit this format, please try one of the other tracking systems.",

      q: "When I track my international Fastexpress-courier Express shipments, why do I sometimes get information for a shipment that is not going to the intended destination?",

      a: "Fastexpress-courier periodically recycles shipment waybill numbers for operational reasons. Occasionally this results in information in our system for two shipments travelling under the same waybill number at the same time. Fastexpress-courier is working hard to eliminate these occurrences. In the meantime, please be assured that while this information may be confusing, your physical shipment will be heading to its correct destination and receiving the same careful attention as every other shipment in our network.",

    {
      q: "I have tracked a shipment and been told to contact Fastexpress-courier. Why is this?",

      a: `This usually occurs if the information we have is insufficient to track the shipment for you. Additional information or clarification may be required in the event of an incorrect address, for example. The matter can be resolved very quickly by contacting customer services.`,
    },
    {
      q: "The tracking results are showing that my shipment is going to a different town or city than it was initially addressed to. Why is this?",

      a: "Destinations shown on Fastexpress-courier Express tracking results are based on the location of the Service Station  providing that pickup or delivery. Please be assured that your shipment is being delivered to the destination provided by you when you completed the waybill for your shipment(s).",

      q: "There were shipments displayed, but mine wasn't listed.",

      a: "Sometimes several shipments use the same tracking number. If that is the case, we display the first ten results. Please try using a pieceID / container number if available.",
